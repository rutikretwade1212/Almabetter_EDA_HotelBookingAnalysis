## üåü **Project Overview**
Hotels face constant challenges in predicting customer trends and maximizing occupancy. This project dives deep into booking data to explore trends, identify patterns, and highlight factors influencing customer decisions. The analysis aims to support decision-making and drive data-informed strategies for hotel management.

---

## üéØ **Key Objectives**
1. Analyze booking patterns to uncover seasonality, lead times, and cancellation trends.
2. Identify factors affecting customer preferences and booking behavior.
3. Provide actionable recommendations to optimize occupancy and revenue.
4. Develop visualizations for easy interpretation of complex data.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies and Tools**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Visualization Tools:** Tableau, Power BI
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

---

## üìä **Data Insights**
The dataset includes information on two types of hotels: city and resort hotels. Key data points analyzed include:
- **Booking Details:** Lead time, arrival dates, and cancellation status.
- **Customer Demographics:** Country, market segment, and distribution channels.
- **Revenue Factors:** Daily rates, length of stay, and special requests.
- **External Influences:** Seasonal trends, holidays, and weekends.

## üîç **Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights**
1. **Customer Preferences**:
   - City hotels are preferred for shorter stays (2-3 days), while resort hotels attract longer stays (5-7 days).
   - Guests from Western Europe dominate the booking trends.

2. **Seasonality**:
   - Peak bookings occur during summer for resort hotels and in December for city hotels.
   - Weekends see higher occupancy rates across both types of hotels.

3. **Cancellations**:
   - Around 20% of bookings are canceled, with longer lead times correlating to higher cancellation rates.
   - Online travel agents have a higher cancellation rate compared to direct bookings.

4. **Revenue Optimization**:
   - Higher daily rates are observed during holidays and summer months.
   - Guests with special requests tend to book premium room types, increasing revenue potential.
