## Hotel Booking Analysis

This Hotel Booking Analysis EDA project delves into the investigation of cancellations and their underlying patterns. It also provides actionable measures to minimize cancellations and boost revenue.

The project encompasses booking data for both a city hotel and a resort hotel, including details such as booking dates, length of stay, and guest demographics. It navigates through the fundamental concepts of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the visualization process.

In this project, we conduct EDA to explore the dataset thoroughly and suggest strategies for reducing cancellations and securing revenue. For instance, hotels can consider offering early booking discounts or promotions for longer stays. They can also incentivize guests by providing perks like free parking or complimentary breakfast when booking directly with the hotel, rather than through third-party websites.

The EDA process comprises three key steps:
1. **Univariate Analysis:** This involves examining individual variables to gain insights.
2. **Bivariate Analysis:** Here, we compare pairs of variables to uncover relationships.
3. **Multivariate Analysis:** Similar to bivariate analysis, but we consider interactions among multiple variables.

In conclusion, this project underscores the importance of analyzing hotel booking data and understanding cancellation patterns. By doing so, hotels can strategically address cancellations and work toward increasing their revenue.
